TODO List:

- [ ] Integrate GitHub with Railway
- [ ] Actually build .py files from notebooks
- [ ] Find a way for people to save their tierlists in a secure way
  - [x] Partially done, people can save their tierlist, but it's just a token reference
- [x] Make it so people can filter groups of characters in the tierlist
- [ ] Maybe create user groups?
- [ ] Use tierlists to build a NMF or similar model to generate latents
- [ ] Create a way for people to check which characters have high latent values
- [ ] Create a way for people to check characters that are similar to their preferences vs other people (anonymous)
